# Hyas ⚡️

> Hugo-powered Jamstack framework for building production-ready websites faster

- __Hugo-powered__. Build your multi-page website with the flexibility and speed of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hyas installs Hugo locally in your project.
- __Jamstack__. Build a web experience decoupled from data and business logic with the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architectural approach.
- __Community__. Contribute to Hyas code, documentation, or discussions. Share your ideas, or get help on [Discussions](https://github.com/h-enk/hyas/discussions).
- __Security aware__. Get A+ scores on [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/hyas.netlify.app) out of the box. Easily change the default Security Headers to suit your needs.
- __Fast by default__. Get 100 scores on [Google Lighthouse](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=73a46ae67cbe2f70318635b09a548ff0) by default. Hyas removes unused css, prefetches links, and lazy loads images.
- __SEO-ready__. Use sensible defaults for structured data, open graph, and Twitter cards. Or easily change the SEO settings to your liking.
- __Development tools__. Code with confidence. Check styles, scripts, and markdown for errors and fix automatically or manually.
- __Bootstrap framework__. Build robust, flexible, and intuitive websites with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Or use any other front-end framework if you prefer.
- __Netlify-ready__. Deploy to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with sensible defaults. Easily use Netlify Functions, Netlify Redirects, and Netlify Headers.
